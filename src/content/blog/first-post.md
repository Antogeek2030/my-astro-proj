## Common Car Issues Requiring Urgent Mobile Repair in Nairobi
Cars in Nairobi often face issues that demand urgent repair. For example:

- Flat tires pop up from nowhere due to bad roads, sharp stones or worn-out rubber.
- Batteries die, especially in older rides, leaving you stranded. 
- Engines overheat when in traffic or during hot days. 

When your car breaks down in these conditions, it can be hard to find help, especially on congested roads like Mombasa Road. 

Waiting for a tow or limping to a garage to get a mechanic takes time, leaving you stuck on the roadside.
