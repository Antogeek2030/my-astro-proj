This guide will discuss the steps to take during a car lockout, available lockout services in Nairobi, the best assistance options, and the typical costs involved.

## Steps to Take During a Car Lock Out in Nairobi

Do this when you are locked out of your car:

1. Stay calm. Panicking does not help, but a clear head will help you think straight and solve the problem.
1. Assess the situation and figure out your options. Check if you have a spare key in your bag or at home and if someone can deliver it. 
1. If you don't have a spare key, don’t unlock the door using available tools. It might seem convenient, but you can spoil your car lock system and increase the repair cost. 
1. Contact a car lock-out assistance provider to help unlock your car. Wait for them to arrive. 

## Car Lockout Services Available in Nairobi

Let’s discuss the options you can choose to unlock your car. 

### Hire an expert locksmith

The best option when faced with a car lock out challenges is to hire an experienced locksmith. They often offer mobile car lockout services in Nairobi and beyond. 

Locksmiths are available 24/7 and come to you whether stuck in Westlands, Kilimani, or the Industrial Area. They're also equipped with the right tools to open any car, old or new, and without a scratch. 

Wherever you are stuck in Nairobi, contact us to help you unlock your car. 

### Use Mobile apps

Technology comes in handy for unlocking vehicles. Mobile apps and car manufacturer support offer innovative solutions for newer vehicles, offering quick easy fixes.

A good example is Toyota. If you drive a compatible model like XXX, the Toyota App lets you unlock your doors straight from your phone. It’s quick, simple, and works anywhere with a signal. 

BMW offers the same with “My BMW App.” It can unlock your car remotely, no matter where you are, as long as your vehicle supports it. 
However, not all cars have these features. Check your owner’s manual or the manufacturer’s website to see if your vehicle qualifies. 

### Car manufacturer support

Another solid option is to use dealerships, especially if you have a new vehicle under warranty or service plans. 

In Nairobi, Toyota or BMW dealerships might offer assistance if you’re locked out. They could send someone to unlock your car or guide you through using the app. Call ahead to confirm they can assist and keep your vehicle details ready. 

Their response times vary, depending on where you are and how busy they are. Stranded drivers in Westlands or Industrial area might get speed assistance since they’re closer to major service centers. 

### Hire a mechanic in local estates

Mechanics or “fundis” in estates often know how to unlock cars using basic tools and years of experience to open doors.

Good fundis know cars inside and out, from older models to newer ones with tricky locks. When you need help, ask around, and someone may point you to a trusted mechanic nearby. 

You might find them in roadside workshops or roaming around, tools in tow, offering quick fixes at cheaper rates.

## Costs of Car Lockout Services in Nairobi

The typical cost for car lockout services ranges from KSh 3,000 to KSh 10,000 (depending on when and where they occur). 

Getting assistance in the city during the day can be cheap. However, you'll pay a higher price late at night. 

For instance, a late-night lockout in Lavington can increase costs. Locksmiths charge more for odd hours since they have to wake up and work while others sleep. 

Distance matters too. Closer means cheaper, and farther means pricier. If you’re stuck in the outskirts like Rongai, you may pay more than if you’re around the CBD.
