We’ll discuss the benefits of flatbed towing and what makes our company the go-to towing service in Nairobi. 

## Why Choose Flatbed Towing?

### Transport Accident-Damaged Vehicles

A car involved in an accident can end up losing several parts like the wheels, bonnet, windscreen, and many more. 

The last thing you would want to hear is that a mechanic caused more damage to your vehicle when transporting it to the garage. This will increase your car repair costs and slow down insurance claims. 

Fortunately, flatbed towing solves that. 

Flatbed trucks handle everything from minor car accidents to major wrecks with care to minimize damage. Your car will be lifted off the ground with caution, loaded onto the flatbed, and safely delivered where you want it. 

### Transport Luxury Vehicles

Own a luxury vehicle like an SUV and sports cars? Such cars have expensive parts that need careful handling. Flatbed towing is the best choice for moving the cars. 

Flatbed towing experts will lift your ride onto the bed so it stays off the road, avoiding wear and tear on parts like tires and suspension. 

They will then deliver your ride to your home or garage without a single mark. 

### Best For Long-Distance Towing

Need to move your car from Nairobi to distant cities like Nakuru or Mombasa? 

If so, using a flatbed towing service could protect your car from damage. 

Once your car is loaded on the flatbed, it is kept steady with tightly secured straps for the whole trip, no matter the distance.

Your car won’t pass through bad roads with potholes, preventing your tires from grinding and your suspension from breaking. 

### Versatile in Nature

The setup for flatbed trucks accommodates transporting a wide range of cars, from personal cars, SUVs, trucks, and even motorcycles. Most towing service providers have tow trucks with different designs of flatbeds to meet the needs of all clients. 

This flexibility means you won’t get left behind and feel stressed when you have a low-rider or a heavy-duty car that needs towing.
