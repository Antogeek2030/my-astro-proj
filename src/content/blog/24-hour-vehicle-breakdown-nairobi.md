Vehicles often break down on Nairobi roads from Westlands, Thika, to the interior sections like Kitengela. 

It can be hard to get immediate help when you’re somewhere new or far away from your regular route. 

That’s where round-the-clock vehicle breakdown assistance comes in–helping you when in distress.  

We offer 24-hour breakdown services, tackling emergencies with skill and speed to avoid inconveniences in your daily schedules. 

The services we offer include: 

- Roadside repairs - fixing flats, jump-starting batteries, solving minor technical issues, etc. 
- Fuel delivery - delivery of enough gas to get you going if you’ve run dry.
- Towing Services - for car issues that can’t be fixed by the roadside, we’ll tow your car to your home or garage. 
- Battery Replacement - if jump-starting fails, we can replace your battery with a new one. 

Call us at *0797466737* to get vehicle breakdown assistance wherever you’re stuck in Nairobi.

When on the call, disclose your location and what’s wrong with your vehicle (flat tire, a dead battery, etc). 

The more you disclose, the quicker we can pack the right tools and head over to you and deliver the best service.
